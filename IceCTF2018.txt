We are given a zip file
Password protected > used fcrackzip -v -D -u -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hardshells > PASSWORD FOUND!!!!: pw == tacos
Extracting the file gives us a Minix Filesystem > d: Minix filesystem, V1, 30 char names, 20 zones

Then mount the file d >> mount -t minix d /mnt

traverse to /mnt we have a file in there called 'dat' > dat : data

Open the dat with bless hexeditor > there is a malformed png header > 89 50 55 47 > .PUG
When changing the header to 89 50 4E 47 .. we have a file with a valid png header. 

save the file and it becomes a png img. 
Open the png and the flag is in there!
